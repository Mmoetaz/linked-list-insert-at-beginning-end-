When we use a linked list in programming you can insert a node at any position
at the beginning ,at the end and in the middle(with conditions).

And here I made a program that allows you to insert at the beginning 
with the **LiFo (last in first out)** algorithm 
and another program using **FIFO (first in first out)** algorithm
